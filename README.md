# Unlock the power of GRASS GIS (FOSS4G NA 2023 workshop)

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks for FOSS4G NA 2023 workshop.

## How to run the notebooks
The workshop can be run online in [WholeTale](https://wholetale.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). This is a convenient way, since no installation is needed.

#### WholeTale
WholeTale is a scalable, open source, web-based platform for reproducible research.

1. Go to https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/653491f2c67faf246f3aa36a
2. Log in (there are different options)
3. Run Tale (blue button at the top right)
4. Confirm Copy and Run Tale
5. If it keeps showing Importing... try to reload
6. Run Tale

#### Google Colab

In Colab:
1. File-> Open notebook
2. Select Github
3. Paste https://github.com/ncsu-geoforall-lab/grass-gis-workshop-foss4gna-2023/blob/main/colab_notebook.ipynb

In Google Colab we don't have pre-installed the software needed, so go ahead and execute the first part to install it. Also, in order to avoid repeating the installation, we merged all notebooks into one.


## Abstract
GRASS GIS is a desktop GIS and a feature-rich geoprocessing engine. In this workshop, we will explain and practice GRASS GIS concepts like computational region or mask and demonstrate them on examples of efficient raster, vector, and imagery processing. The workshop will run in a JupyterLab environment, introducing Python scripting for workflow automation. We will also take advantage of the latest GRASS GIS Python features for Jupyter, including 2D, 3D, web map, and temporal visualizations. This workshop is suitable for both new and experienced GRASS GIS users. While participants can run the workshop locally if desired, we will use a cloud environment so no installation will be required.
